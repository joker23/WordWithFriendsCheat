This is just done individually just for fun so I don't really care 
what you do with it

running this is pretty simple, I used an Ant Build to package my files 
if for some reason you would want to do it yourself then you can get 
instructions of how to do this by visiting http://ant.apache.org/

or you could just run the jar file. 

again I didn't really spend too much time on this but if you have any
feature requests or update requests then you can email me at zhangksteven@gmail.com
or visit my website at zhangksteven.wix.com/steven-zhang

Instructions on how to use this program:

- the top textfield is where you will enter in LOWERCASE letters (basically all the letters that you
want to find words for) 

- the bottom textfield is where you will type in the filter for the results that you get 
 * note that the filter will follow java's implementation fo regular expressions (regex)
   for example typing in [a-z]* in the textfield will be useless (becuase that essentially is the 
   regex for any combination of lowercase letters. If you don't know how to use regex then do yourself
   a favor and learn it here: http://www.vogella.com/articles/JavaRegularExpressions/article.html

enjoy :)
